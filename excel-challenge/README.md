# Module 1 - Excel Challenge
**1. Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?**
1. Theater projects accounted for about 34% of all projects and had the highest number of failed, successful, and canceled projects.
2. January and July are the best months to create a successful project, whereas September is likely to result in a failed project.
3. These crowdfunding websites are most popular for plays.

**2. What are some limitations of this dataset?**
* The dataset only contains a small sample of projects that are available across a 10-year range.
* Dataset only represents 7 countries.
* Category list in the dataset provided has 9 categories while category list available on KickStarter is 15. There are categories missing. Can make assumption that sub-category list is also not comprehensive.
* Dataset only contains country. City and State are additional data that could provide additional insight.
* Dataset does not contain upcoming projects.

**3. What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?**
* A scatter plot could be used to see the correlation between outcome and country. This would show project outcome correlation based off location. For example, are more projects in the US a success or failure?
* Pie chart could be used to show what percentage of the different categories were successful, failed, or canceled for a given year. This would give insight into whether that platform is best for a particular category.
* Another pivot table where it includes staff pick and/or spotlight for each category or sub-category. This would show how a project with these designations would affect the outcome. This would allow us to conclude if there is any value to having these labels.
* A pivot table with another line graph where it includes the date created and amount of money pledged to show which months may have more people pledging money. If a particular month had more pledges, a project may be more successful if started in that month.
